 GRI_CYOA_everything_is_on_fire:0 "Everything Is On Fire"
 GRI_CYOA_everything_is_on_fire_desc:0 "The reaction to Ferdinand's coup has been slightly more... enthusiastic than expected. That is to say, there is a crowd outside our headquarters and they seem very eager to get their claws on Ferdinand, or more specifically around his neck."

 GRI_CYOA_calm_the_fuck_down:0 "Please Send Help"
 GRI_CYOA_calm_the_fuck_down_desc:0 "Ferdinand has sent out a call for assistance to the few units loyal to him outside the city. The message itself calls on them to make their way to Griffenheim very fast, and to make ready for combat once they arrive. Hopefully, they will arrive soon. If they do not arrive, well then we might as well shoot ourselves now to save the firing line some bullets."
 
 GRI_CYOA_secure_the_streets:0 "Panzers On The Streets"
 GRI_CYOA_secure_the_streets_desc:0 "With our reinforcements finally having arrived and Griffenheim firmly in our claws the time has come to enforce order on the streets. Order, in this case, will come in the form of a 20-tonne steel beast of death and destruction, let's see them try to bring that down with rocks and rifles."
 
 GRI_CYOA_hang_them_high:0 "Corpses On The Lamp Posts"

 GRI_CYOA_a_bullet_for_the_priests_desc:0 "The knights of the Empire have apparently not gotten it through their skulls that we are in charge.

 GRI_CYOA_a_message:0 "With A Message"
 GRI_CYOA_a_message_desc:0 "A certain griffon has been a thorn in our side ever since the coup. He does possess a large amount of influence within the Empire, and moving against him will certainly be difficult. But if he cannot accept the new status quo, then he must go."

 GRI_CYOA_traitors_within:0 "A Bullet For The Soldiers"
 GRI_CYOA_traitors_within_desc:0 "The military has been pretty firmly split between those who support Ferdinand and those who are against him. Now, if we consider this from a legal perspective, if they refuse to accept the authority of the new leader then they refuse to accept the authority of the Empire itself. That is quite clearly treason, and the punishment for treason is quite clear as well."

 GRI_CYOA_what_they_deserve:0 "And A Noose For The Commanders"
 GRI_CYOA_what_they_deserve_desc:0 "Now that the common soldiers have been dealt with, the time has come for us to deal with the officers.

 GRI_CYOA_shoot_the_nobles_desc:0 "The nobles simply can't seem to shut up.

 GRI_CYOA_kill_eros:0 "'Retire' Eros"
 GRI_CYOA_kill_eros_desc:0 "Right, so the last attempt we made at the life of Eros was... less than successful. But the fact remains that we cannot tolerate his presence anymore. And when subtler methods fail, direct ones might succeed."

 GRI_CYOA_a_portrait_in_every_home:0 "Reform The Monarchy" ###TODO
 GRI_CYOA_a_portrait_in_every_home_desc:0 "Lord Protector Ferdinand has truly saved the Empire from destruction, and it is only fitting for such a monolithic figure to be adored by the populace. However, many still remain loyal only to the emperor, ignoring Ferdinand's authority.

 GRI_CYOA_ministry_of_propaganda_desc:0 "The press has never been an ally of the state, peddling vile rumors, and lies against the government at every turn.

 GRI_CYOA_kulturekampf:0 "Neuekultur"
 GRI_CYOA_kulturekampf_desc:0 "A reborn empire needs a reborn culture, one that emphasizes the correct traits that every griffon should possess. Bravery, loyalty, and obedience shall be ingrained into the very fabric of society, lest the rot that infested the Empire return."
 
 GRI_CYOA_the_war_economy:0 "The War Economy"
 GRI_CYOA_the_war_economy_desc:0 "The economy only exists to serve the state, and the state only exists to battle its enemies through war. Thus, the economy must be tuned towards war. The factories will produce their goods to our exact specifications, and they will do so without complaint."
 
 GRI_CYOA_convert_the_factories:0 "Convert The Factories"
 GRI_CYOA_convert_the_factories_desc:0 "A large number of factories within the imperial city are dedicated to the production of pointless baubles and toys for the civilian population.

 GRI_CYOA_military_industrial_council_desc:0 "Several prominent industrialists have been far more agreeable to our demands than the others, and such dedication and loyalty to the state should be rewarded.

 GRI_CYOA_we_need_more_desc:0 "The citizens of the Empire will have to sacrifice much for the state, longer hours with lower pay will have to be tolerated, and unemployment will be eradicated amongst the working population.

 GRI_CYOA_reform_the_army_desc:0 "The Imperial Army has been plagued with cowards and traitors for too long. The Lord Protector will transform it into a truly noble force, one utterly dedicated to their mission, and one with absolute faith in the decisions of the leadership."
 
 GRI_CYOA_new_officers:0 "New Officers"
 GRI_CYOA_new_officers_desc:0 "Several promising officers that joined the Lord Protector in the coup have shown a good understanding of strategy, as well as complete loyalty to the state. With such aptitude and dedication, a promotion is no doubt in order."
 
 GRI_CYOA_no_more_police:0 "Merge The Police And The Army"
 GRI_CYOA_no_more_police_desc:0 "The police exist to ensure order on the streets and the loyalty of the populace. The military also exists to undertake these tasks. We should eliminate this institutional redundancy within the Empire by merging these two forces into one. "

 GRI_CYOA_citizenship_for_service:0 "No Place For Cowards"
 GRI_CYOA_citizenship_for_service_desc:0 "The Imperial Army is a place for the very best of the best, and as such is no place for cowards. Every single new recruit shall be transformed into a machine of war, completely obedient and willing to die for the Empire. To do anything less would simply be inefficient."

 GRI_CYOA_into_the_south:0 "Operation: Herzschmerz"
 GRI_CYOA_into_the_south_desc:0 "The former vassals of the Emperor boldly declared their independence and condemned the coup. They will soon regret their foolish loyalty to the old order! Our glorious Lord Protector shall lead our armies to utterly crush these rebels and once more reunite Herzland under one banner. We may be outnumbered, but the mighty Reichsarmee cannot be beaten with mere numbers!"

 GRI_CYOA_core_the_universities:0 "Crush The Southerners"
 GRI_CYOA_core_the_universities_desc:0 "The southerners have attempted in vain to establish their own national identities separate from the empire. We shall show them that these misguided and foolish attempts have done nothing to aid them and that they are all ultimately citizens of the Empire."

 GRI_CYOA_greenback_aluminum_desc:0 "The traitors of the south renounced any rights that they might have had the very second that they rebelled from the Empire. And as we have vanquished these traitors, it is only right that their property is put to proper use. "
 
 GRI_CYOA_angriver_factories:0 "Burn The Forests"
 GRI_CYOA_angriver_factories_desc:0 "The vast forests of the south have prevented the construction and development of the region for too long. This has to change, so we need to get rid of the forest quickly and efficiently. An elegant solution has been proposed: We simply burn it down."

 GRI_CYOA_secret_projects:0 "Wunderwaffen"
 GRI_CYOA_secret_projects_desc:0 "With the more traditional areas of research now dealt with, the time has come to address some of the more... unorthodox ideas that our scientists have had.

 GRI_CYOA_core_the_dogs_desc:0 "The griffons of Strawberry and the dogs of Bronzehill have proven themselves to be convinced of some wild delusion that they are not the rightful subjects of the empire. And sometimes the owner of a dog must remind it of who its master really is."

 GRI_CYOA_ban_the_feathisian_language_desc:0 "The oil fields of Feathisia could be put to much better use by the state, and as the victors, it is only right that we take what is ours. The denizens of Feathisia will deliver the oil fields to us, willingly or otherwise."

 GRI_CYOA_expell_the_dogs:0 "Expel The Dogs"
 GRI_CYOA_expell_the_dogs_desc:0 "The dogs simply cannot stop talking about the late emperor, and this has grown into a problem too large to ignore. They can whine about his death all they want outside of the Empire, as they have proven that they cannot be trusted to serve as loyal citizens."

 GRI_CYOA_push_into_the_north_desc:0 "To the north lie the vile traitors of the Griffonian Republic.
